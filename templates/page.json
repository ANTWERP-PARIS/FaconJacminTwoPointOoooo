After graduating from La Cambre, Alexandra worked for Maison Martin Margiela and Jean-Paul Gaultier. <\/p><p><strong>FAÇON JACMIN is an attitude<\/strong>. <\/p><p>With their label, the twins aime to give women more confidence and empower them in their everyday life, helping to express themselves to the fullest.<\/p><p>Alexandra’s designs explore the codes of seduction, and the alliance of masculinity and femininity. If denim remains her field of predilection, other fabrics are intertwined with it, to present a playful silhouette, meddling boldness and charm – a vision for an eco-conscious, modern, desirable, and determined woman. <\/p><p>The sisters are committed to making the best possible quality of clothes, that aim to last for a lifetime.  With their label, they take the lead to boost ecological initiatives in response to consumer demands and to reduce the industry’s environmental impact. <\/p><p>They are sourcing the best quality fabrics in Italy, and select mainly certified organic cottons. Next to that, they make it a point of honor to work only with confection ateliers based in Europe, i.e.: Italy, Portugal and Bulgaria.<\/p><p><\/p><p>They also value upcycling and  frequently release upcycled capsules.<br\/><\/p><p>Above that, the twins continue to try implementing sustainability in all different steps of the channel, with for instance having recycled packaging.<\/p>"
