After graduating from La Cambre, Alexandra worked for Maison Martin Margiela and Jean-Paul Gaultier.<\/p><p><strong>Façon Jacmin is an attitude.<\/strong><\/p><p>With their label, the twins aim to give individuals more confidence and empower them in their everyday life, helping to express themselves to the fullest.<\/p><p>Alexandra's designs explore the codes of seduction, and the alliance of masculinity and femininity. If denim remains her field of predilection, other fabrics are intertwined with it, to present a playful silhouette, meddling boldness and charm - a vision for an eco-conscious, modern, desirable and determined woman.<\/p><p><strong>SUSTAINABILITY AT THE HEART<\/strong><\/p><p>The sisters are committed to making the best possible quality of clothes, that aim to last for a lifetime. With their label, they take the lead to boost ecological initiatives in response to consumer demands and to reduce the industry's environmental impact.<\/p><p>They are sourcing the best quality fabrics in Italy, and select mainly certified organic cottons and waterless denims. Next to that, they make it a point of honour to work only with confection ateliers bases in Europe, Italy, Portugal and Bulgaria.<\/p><p>They also value upcycling and frequently release upcycled capsule collections.<\/p>"
